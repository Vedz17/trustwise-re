🎮 Game Name: Money Quest – Learn & Win
🌟 Core Idea

A simple, visual-first game where users (even if illiterate) can play levels about financial literacy by tapping, dragging, or choosing pictures. Each level is fun, short, but slightly harder than before. Winning gives coins, stars, and small surprises.

🏆 Game Flow
1. Level Selection Screen

Shows a path (like Candy Crush or Subway Surfers map).

Levels 1 → 10 are visible. Locked levels are greyed out with a lock icon.

Each completed level gives stars and unlocks the next one.

2. Gameplay per Level

👉 Level 1: Saving or Spending

Show 2 big pictures:

Piggy bank 🐷 (saving)

Shopping bag 🛍 (spending)

User taps one.

If they tap piggy bank → 🎉 fireworks + coins shower.

If wrong, friendly popup says: "Try again! Saving helps you win more later."

👉 Level 2: Needs vs Wants

Show multiple icons: Food 🍲, House 🏠, Mobile 📱, Gold ring 💍.

User drags “needs” into the ✅ basket and “wants” into ❌ basket.

Reward animation: stars + happy sound.

👉 Level 3: Good Loan vs Bad Loan

2 characters appear:

Farmer taking loan for seeds 🌱

Person taking loan for luxury car 🚗

User chooses the good loan.

Reward: extra 5 coins.

👉 Level 4: Avoiding Scams

A popup man offers: "Give me 100, I’ll give you 1000 tomorrow!" (cartoon scammer).

Option A: Believe him 🤔

Choosing scammer → lose 1 heart ❤️.
